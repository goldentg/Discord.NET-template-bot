[![Add Nyme to your server here](https://img.shields.io/badge/Bot-Add%20Nyme-brightgreen)](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=808888674900508723&permissions=8&scope=bot)

## **Notes**

This bot is still in early development and frequent updates will be rolling out often. Check back in often to see what is new. Suggerstions for future implementations are appreciated and can be left in the discussions tab. If you have no programming skills I highly reccomend adding the bot [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=808888674900508723&permissions=8&scope=bot) rather than hosting this bot locally.

**Add Required Information**

Once you have downloaded the bot files, you must now create a file named `appsettings.json` in the brainKiller folder and add the following into that file: 

```
{
    "token": "INSERT-TOKEN-HERE"
}
```

You will also need XAMPP and Java JDK in order for the database and music abilities to function.
